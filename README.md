1. Configure your client-side

For running mlflow files you need various environment variables set on the client side. To generate them user the convienience script `./bashrc_install.sh`, which installs it on your system or `./bashrc_generate.sh`, which just displays the config to copy & paste.

> $ ./bashrc_install.sh   
> [ OK ] Successfully installed environment variables into your .bashrc!

The script installs this variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL, MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI. All of them are needed to use mlflow from the client-side.

2. Test the pipeline with below command with conda. If you dont have conda installed run with `--no-conda`

```shell
mlflow run git@github.com:databricks/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=0.5
# or
python ./quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py
```

3. *(Optional)* If you are constantly switching your environment you can use this environment variable syntax

```shell
MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9000 MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000 mlflow run git@github.com:databricks/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=0.5
```
